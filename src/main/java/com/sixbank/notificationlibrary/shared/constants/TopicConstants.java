/**
 * Kafka topic names and configuration constants used by the Notification Service.
 *
 * <p>This utility class organizes topic names into logical groups:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code Input} - Topics that the Notification Service listens to (incoming events)</li>
 *   <li>{@code Output} - Topics that the Notification Service publishes to (outgoing events)</li>
 *   <li>{@code DeadLetter} - Topics used to store failed or undeliverable messages</li>
 *   <li>{@code Config} - Default topic configuration constants</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This structure promotes consistency, reuse, and ease of maintenance when dealing with topic
 * names or Kafka topic settings across the service.
 *
 * <p><strong>Usage Example:</strong>
 * <pre>{@code
 *     String topic = TopicConstants.Input.NOTIFICATION_EVENTS;
 *     kafkaTemplate.send(topic, message);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>To prevent instantiation, this class is marked as {@code final} and has a private constructor.
